Last year I didn't write a retrospective of the ending year. I just wrote about how 2010 was the end of an era (and a job) for me. I want to change that and tell you how this year has been for me. It will be a long post (it has two parts!) so I hope it makes up for my six months disappearance of the blogosphere.

## Valladolid
As I just wrote I started the year unemployed. My last job had burned me out from my head to my feet nails. I **still loved the profession** but I wanted to take advantage of my situation (I had no rent to pay back then) and find a company where I could do things _right_.

I had plenty of time so I could read and practice a lot. I kept learning **Ruby** and fell in love with it. That love will be the cause much of what had to come during the rest of the year.

### Wise choices

Back in 2010 I started getting involved with the [Spanish agile community](http://www.agile-spain.com). That brought me the chance of meeting a lot of interesting people. A few of them lived in the same city I did. They had created [a local community](http://agilecyl.org) in which I also got involved. That was the start of a few awesome friendships.


One of this [awesome](http://www.twitter.com/amaliahern) [people](http://www.twitter.com/semurat) had just started [a new company](http://www.wiseri.com) and needed some help with the development. He offered me the chance to help them and I didn't hesitate to take it. That's how I started learning Groovy and Grails (and fell even more in love with Ruby).

The company was located in Madrid so I started spending more time there than I used to (my girlfriend lives in Madrid so I usually was in the city 2 or 3 weekends per month).

### A week in Be Code

In February I had the chance to finally spend a week in Valencia with the awesome crew of [Be Code](http://becodemyfriend.com). That week was one of the most important ones of 2011. The conversations I had there with [Xavi](http://twitter.com/XaV1uzz) shook my world and **made me think a lot**.


I wrote a series of blog posts back then telling how was each day I spent there. They went offline with my old blog but I wanted to [bring them back online](/blog/a-week-in-be-code) (in a bible-length post) as a way of saying _thank you_. I wrote them in Spanish and they will remain that way.


### All together now, and then

In march an awesome event took place in the surroundings of Valladolid: [All Together Now](http://alltogether.es) I took part in it and teamed up with [Germ√°n](http://www.twitter.com/germandz) and [Abel](http://www.twitter.com/amuino) for the first time.

It was also my first kind-of-real experience with Rails which I pretty much enjoyed dragging me even more into the [red-side](http://www.ruby-lang.org).


### A pet project was born

On April [I released my home-built blog](/blog/developing-my-own-blog). I started it as a way of learning some Cucumber, Sinatra and Haml and ended up learning a lot more. The funny thing is that I built up some knowledge that helped me a lot with was about to come.

### The chance I was waiting for

May is one of my favourite months. It's the month I was born on. The weather starts to be awesome. Summer is coming... But this year it brought me a dreamed chance: [being Enrique Comba's apprentice](http://ecomba.org/blog/2011/05/15/the-apprentice/).

I can remember perfectly the Sunday I switched my computer on and read the post. I was shocked and thrilled.  I opened vim and started coding right away. I didn't stop until I had it done. On Monday morning I had already submitted [my solution](https://github.com/jacegu/apprentice_challenge). All I could do was waiting.
