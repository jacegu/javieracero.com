As you may have noticed I haven't been writing much last week and a half. I'm sorry but I will write a little less from now on. The reason was [leaked a few days ago](http://twitter.com/ialcazar/statuses/48497615737864193)...

I have started a new project:  **developing my own blog from scratch**.

I know It might sound like reinventing the wheel. Actually there is a little bit of that. But, since I'm planning to give [a twist to the blog](http://twitter.com/jacegu/statuses/45580626623078400) and I have been looking for a pet project for a while this felt like a good opportunity.

The blog is a Ruby application that uses [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com) and is deployed on [Heroku](http://heroku.com). This way I'll stop "borrowing" hosting from [@patoroco](http://www.twitter.com/patoroco) and have one on my own.

The idea is pretty similar to [toto](https://github.com/cloudhead/toto): **blog posts will be files published through Git** (geeky huh? :·P). No dabatabase. No backend. Just that.

I'm using this project to play around with a few Ruby technologies that I'm actually loving: [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/), [Sass](http://blog.plagelao.com/2011/03/sass-is-so-cool.html), and, of course, [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/). I wanted to put the full BDD cycle in practice. And, I have to tell you, it's kind of hard and requires discipline.

I will also add some Javascript, CSS3 and even HTML5 to the mix eventually.

After a week or so I have almost finished the posting feature. I have the look and feel of the blog ready (it is almost a clone from the wordpress theme I'm currently using but 100% written by my). I also have the [app working on Heroku](http://jacegu.heroku.com) with a hard-coded showcase post.

When the project is a little bit more stable I will release it. Now it's more or less a spike.

I'll keep telling you how the project goes and what happens with what I have published on this one. In the meantime, keep reading ;·)
